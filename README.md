Enhanced Upload field for Symphony CMS
======================================

This small extension aims to provide the ability to override the destination folder defined in the section editor.

A checkbox that allows the overriding of the upload folder by allowing an entry editor to assign a child folder as the upload destination.

This is a proof of concept and not intended for production environments yet.

**TODO**

1. Add a 'Change file' option along side the 'Remove file' <em/> in the field entry box. To allow the ability to pick a file that was previously uploaded.
2. Consider right aligning the selectbox of folders so the Choose File button and selectbox occupy the same horizontal line.. looks neater.
