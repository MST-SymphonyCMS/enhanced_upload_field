Advanced Upload field for Symphony CMS
======================================

This small extension aims to provide the ability to override the destination folder defined in the section editor.

A checkbox that allows the overriding of the upload folder by allowing an entry editor to assign a child folder as the upload destination.

This is a proof of concept and not intended for production environments yet.
